# HR Analytics Project – Power BI

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, model, and visualize HR data using Power BI. I analyzed employee records to help HR teams identify salary gaps, understand why employees leave, and track performance trends across departments.

---

## Project Overview

Using a dataset of 311 employees, I developed an interactive dashboard that answers key HR questions:

1. Are there salary differences by position and gender?
2. What are the most common reasons for employee terminations?
3. How has departmental performance changed over time?

The goal was to support data-driven decisions in HR for improving retention, pay equity, and workforce planning.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI** for data modeling, dashboard creation, and DAX measures
- **Excel** for initial data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** for calculated fields (e.g., Age, Salary by Gender)

- Pay disparities were identified in the IT (Network Engineer, Database Admin) and Sales (Sales Manager) roles.
- Recommended action: Conduct a salary equity review in high-variance departments.

### Termination Trends
Top reasons employees leave:
- Another Position – 23%
- Unhappy – 18%
- More Money – 15%
- Career Change – 12%

Action: Improve employee engagement, job satisfaction, and compensation strategy.
